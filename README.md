Your JavaScript code for the QR code generator had several errors that affected its functionality and readability. The key issues were a **logical flaw**, **incorrect element selection**, and **inconsistent variable names**.

---

### 1. Logical Flow Error

The biggest problem was that both the QR code generation and the download function were triggered by the same button's click event. This created a **race condition**: the download function would attempt to find and save the QR code before the image had been fully created by the `qrcode.js` library. This would often result in a corrupted or empty file being downloaded.

**How I Fixed It:**
I separated the responsibilities of the "Generate" and "Download" buttons. The HTML was updated to have two distinct buttons with clear IDs (`generate-btn` and `download-btn`). In the JavaScript, a `click` event listener was attached to each button, so the generation and download processes now operate independently. I also added a `setTimeout` function to the generation logic to ensure the QR code has enough time to render before the download button is made visible.

---

### 2. Element Selection Error

Your code used `document.getElementsByClassName("qrcode")`, which returns an **HTMLCollection**â€”a list of elementsâ€”even if only one element exists. The `QRCode` library, however, requires a single HTML element to know where to render the QR code. Passing an HTMLCollection would cause the function to fail.

**How I Fixed It:**
I changed the selector to `document.querySelector(".qrcode")`. This method correctly returns a single HTML element, which is exactly what the `QRCode` constructor expects, making the code more robust and readable.

---

### 3. Inconsistent Variable Names

You were using a variable named `generateBtn` to reference the download button and then later tried to use an undefined variable named `downloadBtn` to handle its actions. This mix-up made the code confusing and prone to `ReferenceError`s.

**How I Fixed It:**
I assigned a separate variable to each button: `generateBtn` for the "Generate QR Code" button and `downloadBtn` for the "Download QR Code" button. This clear and consistent naming convention makes the code much easier to read, understand, and maintain.
